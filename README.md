Assignment 1  

 

I made a food app that basically shows different types of meal  suggestions for different type of hours (morning, mid-morning, afternoon, lunch, and after lunch) using android studio. 

This applications consists of  two different types of buttons, the submit button and the reset button whereby the submit button is there to submit any type of time of day for the app to display a meal suggestion and the reset button is there to reset if you maid a mistake when typing the time of day or wheather you wrote something else. 

 

I used two text displays and named one editName and the other i left it like that.
